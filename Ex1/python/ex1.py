## Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 1: Linear Regression

#  Instructions
#  ------------
#
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions
#  in this exericse:
#
#     warmUpExercise.py
#     plotData.py
#     gradientDescent.py
#     computeCost.py
#     gradientDescentMulti.py
#     computeCostMulti.py
#     featureNormalize.py
#     normalEqn.py
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
#
# x refers to the population size in 10,000s
# y refers to the profit in $10,000s
